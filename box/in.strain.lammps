# This file is for a LAMMPS simulation created by James Suter
# The system is polyethane, using the CVFF forcefield
# the simulation will heat up to 500K, cooldown to 200K and then perform unixial stretching in the x direction

## Should we optimize the lammps call depending on the computer setup?

#  Setting a strain constraint every 1 steps in the x-direction on the box at a strain rate of 1e-7 fs-1, position of

##  Is it pertinent to remap the coordinates proportionaly to the applied
##  strains? Should we remap velocities? Or none?

##  maybe timestep for practicality).
