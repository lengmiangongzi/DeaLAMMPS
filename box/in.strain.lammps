# This file is for a LAMMPS simulation created by James Suter
# The system is polyethane, using the CVFF forcefield
# the simulation will heat up to 500K, cooldown to 200K and then perform unixial stretching in the x direction

## Should we optimize the lammps call depending on the computer setup?

#  Setting a strain constraint every 1 steps in the x-direction on the box at a strain rate of 1e-7 fs-1, position of
#  all atoms positions are remapped following an affine transformation, namely proportional to the box deformation.
##  Is it pertinent to remap the coordinates proportionaly to the applied
##  strains? Should we remap velocities? Or none?
##  This command might be moved to the C++ wrapper file (as well as all the
##  commands that can not be set before, probably just the run command, and
##  maybe timestep for practicality).
