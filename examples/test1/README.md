# Streching a macroscopic polyhedron with a Silicon crystal nanostructure

Once you have managed to compile SCEMa, and its dependencies (Deal.II, LAMMPS), you can have a go at this examples which aims at pulling on a few cubic centimeters of silicon.

## Description

A macroscopic polyhedron of 3x3x8cm<sup>3</sup> of material is subject to uniaxial stretching (z-axis) during one microsecond. 

Most of the description of the testing setup and configuration is provided in the file `./inputs.json`, the rest is unfortunately hardcoded (at the moment).
  
The mesh of the macroscopic finite element model is set as:
```
  "continuum mesh":{
    "fe degree": 1,
    "quadrature formula": 2,
    "input": {
      "style" : "cuboid",
      "x length" : 0.03,
      "y length" : 0.03,
      "z length" : 0.08,
      "x cells" : 1,
      "y cells" : 1,
      "z cells" : 2
     }
  }
  ```
  
  
  
Finally, for the execution to run smoothly a few paths have to be set in `./inputs.json`.

The paths to the input, output, restart and log files of the finite element (macroscale) and molecular dynamics (nanoscale) simulations:
```
"directory structure":{
    "macroscale input": "./macroscale_input",
    "nanoscale input": "./nanoscale_input",
    "macroscale output": "./macroscale_output",
    "nanoscale output": "./nanoscale_output",
    "macroscale restart": "./macroscale_restart",
    "nanoscale restart": "./nanoscale_restart",
    "macroscale log": "./macroscale_log",
    "nanoscale log": "./nanoscale_log"
  }
```

The path to the execution scripts as well as force field parameters of LAMMPS, used to simulate the nanoscale systems:
```  
"molecular dynamics parameters":{
    "scripts directory": "./lammps_scripts_sisw",
  }
```

Finally, the path to the spline-based algorithm used to filter redundant molecular dynamics simulations (not used in this example):
```  
"model precision":{
    "spline":{
      "scripts directory": "/path/to/SCEMa/spline"
    }
  }
```

## Execution

Except for the workflow's executable that you have previously build (for example at `/path/to/SCEMa/build/`), all necessary files for the execution of the example are provided in `/path/to/SCEMa/examples/stretched_polyhedron/`. This directory can be placed anywhere on the system, once you have chosen its location simply move to it:
```
cd /chosen/path/stretched_polyhedron/
```

Verify one last time that the paths sepcified in `inputs.json` are all set correctly. Let's assume that you have decided not to modify the location of the example directory, you are now at `/path/to/SCEMa/examples/streched_polyhedron/`

Regarding the input/ouput/restart/log directories, only the input directories need to exist when the simulation is started. Currently, `./nanoscale_input` exists (data regarding molecular structures is stored in it), but `./mcroscale_input` doesn't. Simply create the directory:
```
mkdir ./macroscale_input
```

The example can now be executed (for example using 2 processes) using:
```
mpirun -np 2 ../../build/dealammps ./inputs.json
```

The total execution should take approximately four minutes. 

## Analysis

The simplest post-treatment that can be done is to visualise the evolution of the displacements, forces, strains and stresses on the finite element mesh using [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/). 

The data is located in `./macroscale_log/` stored in the standard VTK file format.

You'll find there two groups of files `history*` and `solution*`, they respectively contain the data of the finite element mesh concerning the quadrature points (stress and strains) and concerning the nodes (forces and displacements).

Files are named as followed `{history,solution}-{timestep}.{process#}.vtu`, hence the multiple files. Conveniently, simply opening the `{history,solution}.pvd` files, enables to access all the data at once.

Here is typically, the displacement field at the end of the simulation (timestep #2), the maximum local displacement is 0.32mm.
